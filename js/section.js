  1.0: "<p><b><i>Shyness</b></i> refers to the tendency to feel nervous or timid when interacting with other \
  people, especially strangers. <b><i>Social anxiety</b></i> is a broader term that includes shyness, as well as the experience of fear \
  when being observed by others (for example, while eating) and performing in front of others (for example, giving a speech). \
  Interacting with others, being observed by others, and performing in front of others are the main types of feared social \
  situations. \
  <br><br>\
  Shy and socially anxious people are nervous in these situations because of what might happen, \
  because of feared outcomes; specifically, they fear that they will say or do something embarrassing \
  (such as spill a drink or forget their lines), show symptoms of anxiety (such as blushing, trembling, and sweating), \
  or otherwise be scrutinized and judged critically by others (for example, as clumsy, incompetent, weak, and so on). \
  The specific details of feared outcomes vary considerably from person to person; however, most social fears come down \
  to a concern about coming up short in the eyes of others.</p>"
