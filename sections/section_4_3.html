            <h3> Observing Your Thoughts: </h3>
            <p>
                Here are a few more ideas for thought watching.
                <br>
                <br> 
                <b><i>Thoughts as waterfall metaphor. </i></b>

                <a href="#popupwaterfall" data-rel="popup" data-position-to="window" data-role="button" data-inline="true" data-transition="fade">Thoughts as waterfall metaphor.</a>

                <div data-role="popup" id="popupwaterfall" data-overlay-theme="a" data-theme="d" data-corners="false">
                    <a href="#" data-rel="back" data-role="button" data-theme="a" data-icon="delete" data-iconpos="notext" class="ui-btn-right">Close</a><img class="popphoto" src="../images/waterfall.png">

                Imagine that you are standing under a strong waterfall. The water is beating down on your hair and skin, and soaking your clothing. The force of the water is pushing you down. You are so completely immersed in the falling water that you almost feel as if you were a part of it. 
                <br>
                <br> 
                Now imagine stepping out of the waterfall and standing beside it. You can see the water cascading down and can perhaps feel a fine mist on your skin. You can also see that you are separate from the water; you are not the water.
                <br>
                <br> 
                Practice stepping out from the waterfall of your thoughts and watching them, instead of being pushed around and dragged down by them.
                <br>
                <br> 
                <b><i>Leaves on a stream. </i></b>
                Imagine that you are standing beside a stream that has a large maple tree at the edge. It's a glorious fall day and the leaves are gradually dropping into the stream. Each leaf has one of your thoughts written on it. 
                <br>
                <br> 
                Practice watching as each leaf (thought) drops into the water and floats downstream. The stream may flow slowly, quickly, or even come to a complete stop at times. Your task is to simply watch whatever happens. You can also do this exercise online at <a href="http://www.thinkmindfully.com/try-it">www.thinkmindfully.com/try-it.</a> 
                <br>
                <br> 
                <b><i>Clouds in the sky. </i></b>
                This is similar to the previous metaphor except that your thoughts are written on passing clouds.
