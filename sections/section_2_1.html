                We are all familiar with basic types of anxious thinking, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>worrying (I won't fit in),</li>
                <li>having anxious memories (It's just like that awful speech I gave in seventh grade),</li>
                <li>evaluating or judging (This isn't going very well, You look like an idiot), and </li>
                <li>making negative comparisons (He's way more interesting than I am). </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Other, slightly more elaborate types of thinking the socially anxious mind favors include the following.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b style='font-size:125%'> Fortune-Telling: </b>
                When your mind predicts what will happen, usually something negative
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>Example:</b> <i>I won't have anything to say, I'll have a panic attack and won't be able to speak, and everyone will discover that I'm incompetent.</i> 
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b style='font-size:125%'>Mind Reading: </b>
                When your mind tells you what others are thinking about you, usually in the form of judgmental thoughts. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                <b>Example:</b> thoughts starting with He thinks..., She thinks..., or They think.. (for example, <i>She must think I'm a nervous wreck</i> or <i>They think I'm stupid and boring</i>).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b style='font-size:125%'>"Shoulding": </b>
                Using statements that include the word "should," is a popular activity of the socially anxious mind.
