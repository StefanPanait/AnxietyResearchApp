                <b><i>Shyness</i></b> refers to the tendency to feel nervous or timid when interacting with other people, especially strangers. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b><i>Social anxiety</b></i> is a broader term that includes shyness, as well as the experience of fear when being observed by others (for example, while eating) and performing in front of others (for example, giving a speech). Interacting with others, being observed by others, and performing in front of others are the main types of feared social situations.
                <br>
                <br>
                Shy and socially anxious people are nervous in these situations because of what might happen, because of feared outcomes; specifically, they fear that they will say or do something embarrassing (such as spill a drink or forget their lines), show symptoms of anxiety (such as blushing, trembling, and sweating), or otherwise be scrutinized and judged critically by others (for example, as clumsy, incompetent, weak, and so on). The specific details of feared outcomes vary considerably from person to person; however, most social fears come down to a concern about coming up short in the eyes of others.

                Emily treated the thought <i>they think I'm weird</i> as if she literally were weird, so she decided not to approach anyone at the party. For Jack, the mere thought of speaking up in class was accompanied by palpitations, as if he were actually speaking, so he chose to say nothing. These examples demonstrate that when you take your thoughts literally (as facts) or <b><i>fuse</i></b> with them, they appear to have authority, as if they were spoken by a big monster, one so powerful that you have no choice but to act on his orders if you want to keep safe.

            <h3>Fusion: Your anxious thoughts send you down the path of avoidance. </h3>
            <p>
                On the other hand, when you are <b><i>defused</i></b> from your thoughts, you see them for what they are: a collection of words and images in your mind. This reduces their power, giving you the freedom to choose how to respond to them.

                In this app, you will take a close look at your anxious thinking, and learn how to apply a wide range of defusion strategies to your fused mind. As you gain experience in unhooking from your anxious thoughts, you will develop the ability to allow your direct experience of social situations to guide your actions, instead of letting your bossy thoughts do so.
