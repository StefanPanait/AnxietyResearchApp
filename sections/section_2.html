        </div>
        <!-- /header -->

        <div data-role="content">
            <p>
                We are all familiar with basic types of anxious thinking, such as:
            </p>
            
                <li><p>worrying (I won't fit in),</p></li>
                <li><p>having anxious memories (It's just like that awful speech I gave in seventh grade),</p></li>
                <li><p>evaluating or judging (This isn't going very well, You look like an idiot), and </p></li>
                <li><p>making negative comparisons (He's way more interesting than I am). </p></li>

            <p>
                Other, slightly more elaborate types of thinking the socially anxious mind favors include the following.
                
            </p>
            <h3> Fortune-Telling: </h3>
            <p>
                When your mind predicts what will happen, usually something negative
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>EXAMPLE:</b> I won't have anything to say, I'll have a panic attack and won't be able to speak, and My coworkers will discover that I'm incompetent. 
            </p>
            <h3>Mind Reading: </h3>
            <p> 
                When your mind tells you what others are thinking about you, usually in the form of judgmental thoughts. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                <b>EXAMPLE:</b> thoughts starting with He thinks..., She thinks..., or They think.. (for example, She must think I'm a nervous wreck or They think I'm stupid and boring).
            </p>

            <h3>"Shoulding": </h3>
            <p>
                Using statements that include the word "should," is a popular activity of the socially anxious mind. Do any of the following "should" phrases sound familiar?
            </p>
            <div id='exercise_3'></div>
            <script>
                document.getElementById('exercise_3').innerHTML = exercise_3;
                loadExercise_3();
            </script>


            
            <h3>Postmortem: </h3> 
            <p>
                When your mind rehashes or ruminates about what you think happened (or should have happened) in a social situation.The following is an example of a "postmortem" review that Jack engaged in after he gave a presentation at school:
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>EXAMPLE:</b> <i>Oh no, I really screwed up that presentation. I should have prepared more. I can't believe I made that stupid comment about finances. And I forgot to mention the plan I've been preparing. What an idiot! The prof sure had a disappointed look on her face. I bet she dislikes having me in her class. I'm definitely going to fail!</i>
            </p>
            <h3>The Spotlight Effect: </h3> 
            <p>
                To always feel as if you are the center of attention, as if a spotlight were shining on you for everyone to see (and judge you). 
            </p>
            <h3>Generating Stories:</h3> 
            <p>
                Generating Stories: generating stories specifically about who you are in social situations, sometimes pretty negative stories (for example, a story about you as a loser).
            </p> 
            <div id='exercise_4'></div>
            <script>
                document.getElementById('exercise_4').innerHTML = exercise_4;
                loadExercise_4();
            </script>
            <div id='exercise_5'></div>
            <script>
                document.getElementById('exercise_5').innerHTML = exercise_5;
                loadExercise_5();
            </script
