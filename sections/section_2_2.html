            <h3>Postmortem: </h3> 
            <p>
                When your mind rehashes or ruminates about what you think happened (or should have happened) in a social situation.The following is an example of a "postmortem" review that Jack engaged in after he gave a presentation at school:
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>EXAMPLE:</b> <i>Oh no, I really screwed up that presentation. I should have prepared more. I can't believe I made that stupid comment about finances. And I forgot to mention the plan I've been preparing. What an idiot! The prof sure had a disappointed look on her face. I bet she dislikes having me in her class. I'm definitely going to fail!</i>

            <h3>The Spotlight Effect: </h3> 
            <p>
                To always feel as if you are the center of attention, as if a spotlight were shining on you for everyone to see (and judge you).

            <h3>Generating Stories:</h3> 
            <p>
                Generating Stories: generating stories specifically about who you are in social situations, sometimes pretty negative stories (for example, a story about you as a loser).
